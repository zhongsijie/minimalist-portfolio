            <p>Phantom validation of continuous radial sampling MRI tracking robotic interventional cardiovascular surgery.</p>
            <p>Cardiovascular dilation surgery is usually performed with DSA navigation, and excessive radiation during imaging can harm both the patient and the physician. Magnetic resonance imaging technology can avoid electromagnetic radiation, but its imaging efficiency severely limits the performance of real-time imaging. The small space and loud noise of the MRI also significantly increased the difficulty of the operation. Therefore, we construct a complete real-time magnetic resonance navigation system through continuous radial scanning mode and corresponding reconstruction methods and formulate a group of scanning strategies. The characteristics of the special derivative catheter under magnetic resonance imaging were tested by combining the partner's magnetically compatible robotic equipment. And the results were quite inspiring. Relying on the custom-defined reconstruction method provided by Gadgetron, the sampling data is processed and visualized in real time by the fast reconstruction method to guide the behavior of surgical instruments. The whole process of cardiovascular dilatation surgery was simulated on the cardiovascular model, and the results of offline post-processing were compared to preliminarily verify the feasibility of this idea.</p>
